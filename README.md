**Cloth simulation:** 0:00 - 1:08

A pinball game was created with working flippers, pause, play and restart functionality. When the game starts, all balls will fall from the top and begin colliding with other objects in the scene. On losing all the given balls, the game will end and show the ending screen with your final score. The flippers rotate around their base point, and gain rotational velocity when they move. This is converted to linear velocity when applied in flipper collision, which also takes into account the distance from the rotation point.

---
**3D simulation:** 0:18 - 1:08

The score is displayed at the top during the game, and once again on the end game screen. Pinball to circle-obstacle collision gives 20 points, while pinball to brown-rectangle gives 10. No other obstacles give points.
